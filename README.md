In this repo is the Weather Dashboard for homework #6.

The weather dashboard allows you to search for cities and get the weather for a
city of your choice, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV
index. It also gives a five-day forecast.

When a city is searched, it is kept in local storage and an icon in the left 
column can be used to access that city.
